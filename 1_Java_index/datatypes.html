    <h2>Datatypes</h2>
    <p>In Java, data types are fundamental to the language's structure, defining how data is stored, manipulated, and interpreted in a program. Java categorizes its data types into primitive types and non-primitive types. Primitive types are the building blocks of data and include eight specific types: byte, short, int, and long for representing whole numbers of different sizes; float and double for decimal values; char for single characters like letters or symbols; and boolean for true/false values. These primitive types are efficient and directly store values in memory, making them fast to access and process. For example, int is often used for counting or indexing, while double is ideal for precise calculations like financial or scientific computations.

        In contrast, non-primitive types, also known as reference types, are more complex and include objects, arrays, classes, interfaces, and enums. Unlike primitive types, they do not store the actual data directly; instead, they hold references (or memory addresses) pointing to where the data resides in the heap memory. For instance, a String in Java, though seemingly a basic data type, is a reference type because it is an object that represents a sequence of characters. Non-primitive types offer more flexibility and functionality, as they allow the creation of custom types, enabling object-oriented programming features like inheritance and polymorphism.
        
        Javaâ€™s strong type system ensures that variables must be declared with a specific data type, which determines what kind of data the variable can hold. This design helps catch errors at compile time, improving code reliability and maintainability. For instance, trying to store a decimal number in an int variable will result in a compile-time error unless explicitly cast. Additionally, Java provides automatic type conversion between compatible types (e.g., int to double), but it requires explicit casting for incompatible types (e.g., double to int) to avoid unintended data loss. This robust type system contributes significantly to Java's reputation for being a secure and developer-friendly programming language.</p>
