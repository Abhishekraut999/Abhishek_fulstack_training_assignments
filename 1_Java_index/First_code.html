    <h2>First code!!</h2>

    <p>
        Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. Java is fast, reliable, and secure. Java is used in every nook and corner from desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet. In this article, we will learn how to write a simple Java Program.<br><br>

<h2>Steps to Implement Java Program</h2>
Implementation of a Java application program involves the following steps. They include:<br>

<ul>
    <li>Creating the program
    </li>
    <li>Compiling the program
    </li>
    <li>Running the program
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
For those who want to deepen their understanding of Java and master the complete development process, pursuing a comprehensive Java programming course can offer structured learning and hands-on experience, enabling you to develop efficient and scalable applications.<br>

    <h3>
        1. Creating Programs in Java
    </h3>

    <p>
        <pre>
            class Test{
                public static void main(String []args){
                    System.out.println("Hello World.");
                }
            };
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Compiling the Program in Java</h3>
<p>To compile the program, we must run the Java compiler (javac), with the name of the source file on the “command prompt” like as follows
    If everything is OK, the “javac” compiler creates a file called “Test.class” containing the byte code of the program.<br>
</p>

<h3>3. Running the Program in Java</h3>
<p>We need to use the Java Interpreter to run a program. Java is easy to learn, and its syntax is simple and easy to understand. It is based on C++ (so easier for programmers who know C++).

The process of Java programming can be simplified in three steps:

Create the program by typing it into a text editor and saving it to a file – HelloWorld.java.
Compile it by typing “javac HelloWorld.java” in the terminal window.
Execute (or run) it by typing “java HelloWorld” in the terminal window.</p>
