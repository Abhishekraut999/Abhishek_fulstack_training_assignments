    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>Loops in Java are powerful constructs that allow repetitive execution of code blocks, making it easier to handle tasks that require iteration. The most basic and commonly used loop is the for loop, which is ideal when the number of iterations is known beforehand. A for loop consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. For example, for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { System.out.println(i); } initializes i to 0, runs the loop as long as i is less than 5, and increments i after each iteration. This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4, demonstrating its utility in tasks like iterating over arrays or counting operations.

        Another versatile loop is the while loop, which executes its code block as long as the specified condition evaluates to true. Unlike the for loop, the while loop is more suited for situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined, and the condition depends on runtime variables. For example, while (x > 0) { System.out.println(x); x--; } decrements and prints the value of x until it becomes zero. This makes while loops ideal for scenarios like reading input until a specific value is encountered or waiting for an external event.
        
        The do-while loop is a variation of the while loop that guarantees the code block will execute at least once, regardless of the condition. In this loop, the condition is checked after executing the code block. For example, do { System.out.println("Processing..."); } while (condition); ensures that "Processing..." is printed at least once. Additionally, Java offers enhanced for loops, also called "for-each" loops, specifically designed for iterating over collections or arrays. This loop simplifies tasks like traversing an array: `for (int num : numbers) { System</p>
