    <h2>Condition Statement</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements in Java allow programs to make decisions based on certain conditions, enabling dynamic and logical control over program flow. The most commonly used conditional statements include if, if-else, if-else-if, and switch. The if statement evaluates a condition enclosed in parentheses, and if it is true, the code block within curly braces is executed. For example, if (x > 10) { System.out.println("x is greater than 10"); } checks if the value of x is greater than 10 and prints a message if true. If there is an alternate path, the if-else construct can handle it, executing one block of code if the condition is true and another if it is false.

        For more complex decision-making, Java offers the if-else-if ladder. This construct allows multiple conditions to be tested sequentially. Once a true condition is found, its corresponding block of code is executed, and the rest are skipped. For example, you could use if-else-if to assign grades based on a numeric score: if (score >= 90) { grade = "A"; } else if (score >= 80) { grade = "B"; } else { grade = "C"; }. This structure makes it easy to handle a series of related conditions without repeating unnecessary checks.
        
        Another powerful tool for handling conditions in Java is the switch statement, especially useful when dealing with multiple discrete values of a variable. The switch statement evaluates a single expression and matches it against multiple case values. If a match is found, the code for that case is executed. For example, switch(day) { case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break; } determines the day based on a numeric input. A default case can handle unmatched values, providing a fallback. Together, these conditional statements give Java developers flexibility to implement decision-making logic effectively, ensuring programs respond dynamically to different scenarios.</p>
